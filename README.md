# ChangeNestMode
Simply marks any thermostat "away" if able (primarily focused on the Nest thermostat).  This is intended to be used with an "Away" or "Home" mode.


Forked original 'Change Nest Mode' by imbrianj for several reasons:
1) Clean up input UI
2) Allow for multiple ST modes to trigger thermostat modes
3) Use ST organization in GitHub for direct integration

Note:
This is my first contribution to the ST community and first time I've worked in Groovy...please go easy on me! -xenokira, 2015.01.15.

Install:
1) Copy contents of Change-Nest-Mode.groovy into new SmartApp in the SmartThings IDE.
2) Save
3) Publish
4) Add SmartApp in SmartThings app.
